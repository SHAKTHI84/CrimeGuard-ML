This project uses machine learning to detect criminal activities in video footage by analyzing each frame for suspicious behavior. The detected information is securely stored using Django, while Web3 authentication (e.g., MetaMask) ensures only authorized users can access the data. It combines video processing, machine learning models, and a secure web interface to provide actionable insights for enhancing community safety.
